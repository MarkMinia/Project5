##### Of the visual programs in my course, we continued to spend more time in Tableau and so it was what eventually led to the tool of choice for creating my second dashboard. The dataset that I chose to use was the 2020 Census, but because of the volume of information provided, I selected only one state along with a few areas to focus on. I chose to use the population size for each county and by major race and gender, estimated ages, and estimated consumer spending.
