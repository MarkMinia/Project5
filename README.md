# Tableau Population Dashboard: Aloha from Hawaii

##### [The People of the Hawaiian Islands](https://public.tableau.com/views/BIProject_16636527150260/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

##### Of the visual programs in my course, we continued to spend more time in Tableau and so it was what eventually led to the tool of choice for creating my second dashboard for the final presentation. We were provided with a few pre-selected datasets and I chose to use the 2020 Census. 

##### In addition to the dataset provided in Kaggle, I also went directly to the state government website to pull information that I couldn’t find in the original dataset. The Census provided data for the different counties: Kauai, Honolulu, Maui, and Hawaii county. There is a 5th county called Kawalao, but in the Census that county is included with Maui because of how small it is and it's next to Maui; it’s the 2nd smallest county in the US based on population.

##### Because of the volume of information, I narrowed my focus down to total Population, race, age, and consumer expenditure. I wanted to create something that could be useful for a small business owner who wanted a quick glimpse into the territory. With this dashboard, he/she will get a general idea of his/her customers. For example, if someone in Honolulu (click Honolulu) wanted to start a business, based on the top results, the optimal crowd that he/she could sell a product or service to are Asian males ages 20 to 40. The line of business would preferably be involved in housing, transportation, or food in some form. Total population growth is trending upwards within the past 10 years which could result in an increase in business. But, one thing to keep in mind is that the purpose of this dashboard isn’t to create guarantees or prevent any alternative ideas to be pursued, but to provide a guide to increase the probability for success; 20 percent of small businesses fail within the first year, so there needs to be results, quickly.

##### In addition to small business owners, this could also be helpful for bigger companies looking to expand. Real-world example would be Kauai. I’m originally from Kauai and there isn’t much on the island; it’s more of the laid-back country-side; opposite of Honolulu. There was a large-scale Sports Authority that opened and 3 years later it closed. Aside from the fact that the company went bankrupt for probably many reasons, their location choices likely contributed to that. The top age groups on Kauai include 55 to almost 70. It’s probably safe to assume that customers in that age range are more than likely to live a sedentary lifestyle and will not be buying Kayaks and barbells. Kauai also has the smallest population of all the counties, so that doesn't help when there isn't much of a crowd on the other end of the transaction.

##### I know there are a lot more specific details to consider, especially when dealing with businesses, but I felt this provided a good way to at least get a general consensus during the initial phases of a business plan.

##### Features on my dashboard:
- ##### Island chain to act as main filter
- ##### Changing dashboard title
- ##### Summary tiles 
- ##### Butterfly graph to compare population by gender
- ##### Bar graph to compare population by race
- ##### Bubble graph to depic where majority of consumer spending is going
